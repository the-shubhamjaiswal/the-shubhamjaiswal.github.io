## Hello World !

This is Shubham Jaiswal.  
I'm 2016 passout from [IIT-BHU Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/) with B.Tech in Electrical Engineeing.  

I work on Lithium-ion batteries. I have been designing battery management system hardware. Recently, I have shifted my attention to -
1. Cell modelling
2. Algorithms for battery management  

Apart from working on batteries, I like to spend my time in listening/reading books and cooking.
